# Barometer

The Barometer web application grants users the ability to quantitatively measure the general population‚Äôs 
emotional view of events and subjects on Twitter in real-time. Through combining Twitter's tweet search API 
endpoint and IBM‚Äôs natural language processing emotion endpoint, the results are aggregated into 6 defined
emotional sentiment categories (%): sadness, joy, fear, disgust, anger, and overall positive vs. negative
outlook. 

Graphical bar graphs and a tweet content pane offers insight into the emotional spectrum and sentiment
revolving any search query. Communicating with a PostgreSQL database enables the application to access and display
what other users have historically searched.

Use cases may include gathering research that will inform corporate messaging strategy, helping an individual
consumer decide whether to attend a certain event, or indexing a user's feelings against the rest of other Twitter
users. The application is effectively a user-driven online social perception survey.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and
testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system. This server runs locally
in conjunction with the barometer-client front-end built with React, which can be found at (https://github.com/RobertWiggins/barometer-client). Please pay specific attention to the required environment variables and API access credentials detailed within the pre-requisites.

# Express setup instructions

2. `cd` into the cloned repository
3. Create a .env file and supply the required environment variables described below
4. Make a fresh start of the git history for this project with `rm -rf .git && git init`
5. Install the node dependencies `npm install`

## Set up local database

Create new database titled barometer
Create new table 'queries', or just enter `npm run migrate` at the terminal

```SQL
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS queries (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
